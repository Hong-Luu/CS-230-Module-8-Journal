# CS 230 Module 8 Journal

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
The client is The Gaming Room, and they have hired Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) to develop a web-based version of their current Android app game called "Draw It or Lose It". The game is based on the classic Win, Lose or Draw concept where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. The software should be web-based and have multi-team and multi-player functionality, unique game and team names, and unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player to ensure that only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time.
