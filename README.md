# CS 230 Module 8 Journal

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The client is The Gaming Room, and they have hired Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) to develop a web-based version of their current Android app game called "Draw It or Lose It". The game is based on the classic Win, Lose or Draw concept where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. The software should be web-based and have multi-team and multi-player functionality, unique game and team names, and unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player to ensure that only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. 

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
In developing this documentation, I was able to clearly articulate the requirements, design constraints, system architecture, and domain model for the Draw It or Lose It project. I also provided a thorough evaluation of the characteristics, advantages and weaknesses of different operating platforms and development tools. I also was able to made recommendations for various system architectures and techniques specific to distributed systems, storage management, memory management, and security. 

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
